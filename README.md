I'm Mateus Sousa, a Senior Software Engineer at [@Luizalabs](https://github.com/luizalabs) and an MSc. Student at [@unifesp](https://github.com/unifesp) in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.

**By day:** I tackle complex software engineering, infrastructure, and architecture challenges at a large scale, working for one of Brazil's biggest retail players, [@Luizalabs](https://github.com/luizalabs).

**By night:** I delve into the fascinating world of deep learning, exploring image classification, image synthesis, and face (expression) recognition tasks at [@unifesp](https://github.com/unifesp).
